title: Men's Superior Mental Faculties over Women
layout: post
---
Recently, this post of mine, and the ensuing conversation thread on Twitter  garnered a lot of inarticulate speech and weak rhetoric that I had somehow insulted Ahmadi Muslim women, and that I was some kind of misogynist, when it was the misogyny within Islam (yes, Ahmadiyyat too) that was one of several factors for which I left the religion.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ahmadiyya Islam&#39;s Qur&#39;anic commentary claims men have &quot;superior mental...faculties&quot; in comparison to women. *Sigh*. <a href="https://t.co/y2YpxikoJP">pic.twitter.com/y2YpxikoJP</a></p>&mdash; Reason on Faith (@ReasonOnFaith) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReasonOnFaith/status/741367106843860992">June 10, 2016</a></blockquote>

To this, one Ahmadi claimed that Ahmadi women knew about this passage, and if they were offended by it, they would have left the Jama'at in "droves":

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/islam_et_media">@islam_et_media</a> No, most haven’t read much and/or are socially under pressure to conform. I’ll help raise awareness, though ;)</p>&mdash; Reason on Faith (@ReasonOnFaith) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReasonOnFaith/status/742468107520839680">June 13, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

You can see here that first, the Ahmadi user @islam_et_media made a generalization about Ahmadi women understanding the passage. I responded that most probably have not read it. 

Re-read my tweet. "Most" does not mean "all". And if you think it does, you need to go back to English class. In short 140 character tweets, especially ones responded to quickly, we're not writing legal documents.

If any of the Ahmadis cared to ask me, "Do you think only women haven't read such passages, or do you think men in the Jama'at are similarly disinclined to be that well read about our theology?" I would have responded with: _both genders!_

And even when my words and intent are misunderstood, I CLARIFY that I believe _both_ genders are not very well read on their own theology, that clarification is not accepted by Ahmadis chiming in and retweeting the mis-characterization by other Ahmadis even _after_ I have already clarified my intent.

Is this the kind of humility Ahmadis are learning in the tarbiyati programs? At their ijtemas? At juma'ah? It's disgraceful.

The Ahmadi Muslims I know in person are far more polite than this lot who've been quick to try to misrepresent my words on Twitter. The truly mature and knowledgeable Ahmadis, of which I have met some on Twitter, don't behave this way. They are wise to understand the different between disrespecting people and challenging theological ideas. They welcome dialog and debate.

We then have a Sadr Lajna, [Ismat Mahmood](https://twitter.com/IsmatMahmood) jump into the fray with more mis-characterization:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/ReasonOnFaith">@ReasonOnFaith</a> this statement is contradictory ..Think it through women or men are more religious or just which side you want to butter?</p>&mdash; Ismat Mahmood (@IsmatMahmood) <a href="https://twitter.com/IsmatMahmood/status/742509420186243072">June 14, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/IsmatMahmood">@IsmatMahmood</a> Not contradictory. You can be more religiously observant but less interested in the minutia of theology. It&#39;s not a dig at you</p>&mdash; Reason on Faith (@ReasonOnFaith) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReasonOnFaith/status/742526477099487232">June 14, 2016</a></blockquote>

Clearly, someone in her post didn't understand that you can be religiously observant Ahmadi woman regardless of being equally disinterested in the theology as most men are in the Community.

Remember, this all started because instead of addressing the _actual_ provocative Ahmadi Muslim Qur'anic commentary, Ahmadis were just itching to find some way to cry wolf, to cry foul and say anything to deflect from the misogynistic commentary text, and onto me personally.

So here's a thought exercise for Ahmadi Muslims to consider:

If I ask the first 10 Lajna (adult women) I meet in the USA who consider themselves religious, what % would have read the passage I cited here and actually remember pondering it (the commentary that men have “superior mental faculties”)? 

What % would I get if I asked the next 10 Khuddam (young adult men) the same question?

In fact, you can do this exercise yourself with people who’ve not heard of this Twitter exchange or this blog post.

My assertion is that BOTH numbers would be quite low. Less than 50% is my guess. 

For honest Ahmadis reading this, you know in your hearts that I have a point, especially if you're one of the rare few among your peers who bothers to read and take an interest at this level. Do this exercise. You don't have to report back on Twitter. Just know in your own heart my generalization about people's theological interest and reading has merit in the real world, because it is what I have grown up observing. Perhaps you have a different experience, but I do feel that my experience here is likely very reflective. And I'm entitled to state my general observations about a Community I had been active in for decades.

For those haters: When there are hadith explaining the “deficiency” in women’s intelligence, isn’t it convenient that you deflect onto me instead of looking at the misogyny in your own commentaries that seem to be inspired by them?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are a few hadith like this one, which you can trace back as plausible influences for the these attitudes. <a href="https://t.co/MKS5emvjsG">pic.twitter.com/MKS5emvjsG</a></p>&mdash; Reason on Faith (@ReasonOnFaith) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReasonOnFaith/status/742668132012195842">June 14, 2016</a></blockquote>

I speak from observing Ahmadi Muslim communities in multiple Western cities, over **decades**. Just because people are religiously observant doesn’t mean that everyone explores their theology. People are interested in different things.

I did a similar exercise years ago on a Shia online forum discussing religion, when I was active in defending Ahmadiyyat. I showed that forum Hazrat Ali’s Nahjul Balagha Sermon 78. At first, the Shia Muslim women shouted the loudest, “That’s a fake! That’s not a Shia book!” Then, some of the moderators on the forum came forward to correct the protests, “Yes, actually, Nahjul Balagha is a well recorded compendium of Hazrat Ali’s speeches.”, etc. Then the men and women who were protesting, went mostly quiet; some expressed disappointment.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ali, the fourth caliph of Sunni Islam / 1st Imam of Shia Islam re-iterated the same sentiments in Nahj Al-Balaghah. <a href="https://t.co/pDy0Fpu6iC">pic.twitter.com/pDy0Fpu6iC</a></p>&mdash; Reason on Faith (@ReasonOnFaith) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReasonOnFaith/status/742669744260648960">June 14, 2016</a></blockquote>

I believe that when most people study their religions carefully and objectively, they will find much that is incredulous which they have just accepted on faith. No single argument will win people over to any side. But after you consider the volume of the arguments on both sides, eventually you'll see what I did -- that Islam, including Ahmadiyyat -- requires many acts of theological and scriptural gymnastics to reconcile with modern notions of fairness and scientific truth.

Most people go to religion for the structure, the community and having some system of connecting with the numinous. Just like some people are interested in Math, others in Physics, not everyone is interested enough to read their theology and challenge it.

That’s my point.
