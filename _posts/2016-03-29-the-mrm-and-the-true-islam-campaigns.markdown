The Muslim Reform Movement (MRM) [Declaration](https://www.change.org/p/muslims-and-neighbors-we-support-the-muslim-reform-movement) from December 2015 and the [Ahmadi](https://www.alislam.org/) Muslim's ['True Islam'](http://trueislam.com/) campaign that followed a few weeks later, both aim to put some definitive statements out there about how a modern and peaceful Islam is not an oxymoron.

### The Muslim Reform Movement

This is a diverse group, and none are beholden to an Ayatollah or other centralized, inviolate figure. This provides a level of freedom in truly critical thought. As a former Ahmadi Muslim myself, this is the level of fresh thinking I yearned for, for decades, but never found within the constraints of Ahmadiyyat.

True, I have trouble seeing how one can get from a lot of the Islamic scriptures to the beautiful Muslim Reform Movement [Declaration](https://www.change.org/p/muslims-and-neighbors-we-support-the-muslim-reform-movement).

But this crawling towards modernity, kicking and screaming is what has held the Muslim world back, in my opinion. And yet at the same time, meet with Muslims privately and off the record, the points in the MRM declaration are exactly what they _want_ to support.

Instead of bickering for the next 100 years on how to do interpretive gymnastics just right to get to the MRM declaration, the Muslim Reform Movement lays down the gauntlet and states with confidence: _these are the principles we feel are non-negotiable for human rights and dignity_. 

It's brilliant. Let's teleport to the values that our hearts and minds _know_ to be true, and leave those interested in the theological work to get there, the task of pontificating on it. Conversely, if you take the precept that the Prophet of Islam was teaching Muslims to be intelligent and independent thinkers of their time, then there's almost no theological hurdles to jump through.

### The Ahmadi Muslim Campaign

Ahmadi Muslims have a wonderful track record of promoting peace. I've touched on that in brief, [here](https://reasononfaith.github.io/2016/03/29/defending-islam-from-the-twitter-trolls-in-denial.html).

As a former Ahmadi Muslim myself (now an ex-Muslim with no religion), I've always felt the slogans of "True" Islam at every annual convention I would go to, and in the new TrueIslam.com campaign, a tad presumptuous. It's the word "true" that's conjures up a little bit of takfir. 

What would have been better, is a slogan such as "A Modern Islam" or a "Peaceful Islam". Now even with those, I think the Muslim Reform Movement would be more deserving of such a title, based on the contents, but you get my drift.

We now how to calculate Ï€, we know what year the American constitution was signed. However, there are tens of thousands of hadith that can steer "Islam" in numerous directions, depending on the ones you keep and the ones you discard.

I personally feel that a lot of the beliefs of Ahmadiyya Muslim doctrine require a revisionist view of history. Even other Muslims who would do well to adopt Ahmadi Muslim conclusions, feel the same about Islamic history.

We're not going to get impartial historians to agree, to a meaningful degree, to state that the Ahmadi Muslim beliefs represent the "true" Islam. And that's effectively what the TrueIslam.com campaign is claiming, without putting the words "Ahmadi" front in center.

No doubt, there's a noble motive here: to try to get other Muslim groups to adopt these principles as their own, and make the world a safer place.

However, the Ahmadi Muslim doctrine is keen to hold on to every verse of the Qur'an and believe in no abrogation and the complete timelessness of the Islamic scripture (Qur'an) and message. As such, Ahmadi Muslims could never and would never make a statement accepting LGBT persons. They avoid the issue in their literature just as they avoid these points in their TrueIslam campaign.

Ahmadis avoid making statements about equal inheritance or equal witness because they're hands are tied. They start with the conclusion that these things were not granted by Allah in the Qur'an, and so work backwards from there.

As each day progresses, information spreads, and people use their critical faculties, these omissions can no longer be ignored.

This is where in my humble opinion, the Muslim Reform Movement represents _real_ reform. I've [pointed out](https://twitter.com/ReasonOnFaith/status/713894927890059264) before how the MRM declaration touches on topics that Ahmadis repeatedly avoid. But we've noticed.

### Islamism and the Public Relations Taboo

I believe that Ahmadi Muslims wish to view themselves as the _defenders of Islam_. But to that PR goal, these well intentioned people don't realize that they are muddying the waters. The "-ism" on "Islam" is an accepted word in our vernacular that refers to political Islam; to a theocracy. Ahmadis claim to believe in separation of mosque and state. So why shy away from this term? Well, because it has the word "Islam" in it.

Similarly, Ahmadis will do the PR tour on the news media claiming how "Islam" doesn't support such-and-such primitive beliefs, as if to reassure the American people that Muslims have peaceful beliefs. They neglect to clarify that these beliefs are from their own denomination, which represents just 1% of the Muslim world. On that basis, the Ahmadi Muslim PR campaign just gave their non-Muslim fellow citizens a false sense of security.

This is placing PR wins for converts above plain speech that presents an honest picture of the situation on the ground.
