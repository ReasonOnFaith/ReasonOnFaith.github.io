Yes, Ahmadi Muslims are the most progressive of those Muslims who believe in the infallibility of the Qur'an, on the topic of female testimony.

Reference: Qur'an [2:283](http://www.alislam.org/quran/search2/showVerse.php?vn=283&ch=2&tPN=114) (note: I'm using Ahmadi Muslim verse numbering here).

Yes, yes, I've heard its just so one woman can remind the other, in case one forgets.

But see how easily this is abused and all of the confusion we have in the Muslim world today? Any supposed "benefit" this conferred would be limited to 7th century Arabia. It clearly doesn't stand the test of time, or even humanity's ethical aspirations.

This verse (2:1 clause) _flies_ in the face of

1. Demonstrating forethought about how it would be abused more than any dubious benefit to society that it conferred
2. Being a universal teaching

Set the testimony aside for a moment. You have to ask yourself honestly, is humankind really better off because of this verse's 2:1 ratio in witnessing? 

Knowing human nature, I submit that this verse has caused more problems and inequity in society than it could ever claim to have solved.

If you were to craft a brand new law, a brand new religion today, you and I would never put such a thing in.
