This is my inaugural post on [ReasonOnFaith.github.io](https://reasononfaith.github.io/). 

You can find my long form blog at [ReasonOnFaith.org](http://ReasonOnFaith.org). 

There, you can read a bit [about me](http://reasononfaith.org/about/), including my [Welcome](http://reasononfaith.org/welcome/) post outlining how I wish to challenge concepts related to religion and inherited belief.

I created this microblog as a companion to my main blog. That blog is for long form and/or more formal writing.

In contrast, this microblog is intended to have much shorter posts for which Twitter is just too short.

Peace, love and tolerance to _all_ of you.

And welcome!
