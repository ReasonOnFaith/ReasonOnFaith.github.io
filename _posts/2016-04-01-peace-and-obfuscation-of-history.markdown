In this [tweet](https://twitter.com/avneet_paul/status/715914253622976512), [Avneet Paul](https://twitter.com/avneet_paul) makes an important point with an article link covering many topics, of which one in particular, was of interest to me for this post. 

That topic is the promotion of peace (obviously admirable and welcome) versus the Ahmadi's insistence that the reams of historical material to the counter, are not part of "true" Islam.

I agree with Avneet that these nuances are important. 

The dichotomy for Ahmadi Muslims regarding peace comes down to: 

1. Action taken today 
2. Ahmadi Muslims take on historical events

### Issue 1: Ahmadis and Peace Today
I completely believe that Ahmadi Muslims would never tolerate violence or terrorism. Their rejection of this is proven (long history of non-violence, clear teachings in their own interpretations of the faith, open door policy at mosques, no fatwas for death, etc.). 

Being a former Ahmadi Muslim, I can state this with confidence. This is why I support Ahmadi positions so strongly _on this particular slice of this particular topic_.

This point is safely, a non-issue.

### Issue 2: Ahmadis and a Selective Reading of History
On issues of history however, I and many others feel that the Ahmadi viewpoint amounts to a historical reconstruction. And if true, that  *would be a dangerous obfuscation* of mountains of troubling material (popular and early biographies of the Prophet, _sahih_ hadith, etc.). 

This historical material is swiftly rejected by Ahmadis, because it doesnâ€™t fit their peaceful narrative. 

Their starting point is that Muhammad was a peaceful man, and anything that paints a different picture, must be tossed out as a fabrication, or given an embellished hypothetical context, that is often suspect.

The volume and presence of this material from history is still troubling. 

This material is thrown out and so easily dismissed as later fabrications to discredit Islam by early hypocrites of the faith, and early historians.

The majority of Muslims do not toss out all of this material the way we and Ahmadi Muslims would like them to. As such, the Islam of the masses still has latent, dangerous ideas floating out there that are the antithesis of peace.

### Reform vs. Renaissance 
It should be noted that Ahmadi Muslims (as far as I have seen) do not refer to themselves as reformers of Islam. Their take is that Islam is the perfect faith, but that it was prophesied in the Prophet's time that Islam would become a mess until the Mahdi and Messiah came to revive its true teachings.

So, you will not get Ahmadis to challenge verses of the Qur'an. Instead, they will seek to normalize an interpretation that supports a superior ethical voice than the simpler reading espoused by many of their co-coreligionists. 

Ahmadi Muslims prefer to view their movement as the _renaissance_ of Islam. As such, they are in fact, more limited in the sort of break-out thinking many non-Muslims are looking to the Muslim world for. 

For that kind of ground-up, fresh restart, you really have to look to groups like the [Muslim Reform Movement](http://reasononfaith.github.io/2016/03/29/the-mrm-and-the-true-islam-campaigns.html) instead.
