title: Defending Islam from the Twitter Trolls in Denial

Dr. Zuhdi Jasser (@DrZuhdiJasser) rightfully calls out the twitter troll @LoveTruth79 in this [comment thread](https://twitter.com/DrZuhdiJasser/status/714771370148765696). Muslims are lucky to have him as one of their own, and Americans are lucky to have this patriot.

Appearing on Fox news doesn't make one anti-Islam. Ahmadi Muslims appear on Fox news too. And they sincerely love Islam. I know, because I grew up Ahmadi Muslim. Sure, I differ on how I look at theology now, but I know their hearts; these people are my friends and family. They are good people, truly trying to make the world a better place. We agree to disagree on methods.

### A Story of Criticism
In my teenage years, I gave a copy of [Jesus in India](http://www.alislam.org/library/books/jesus-in-india) to my high school religious studies teacher, who was a devout Sunni Muslim. This book was written by the founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community over 100 years ago. In the [introduction](http://www.alislam.org/library/books/jesus-in-india/intro.html) of that book, the author slams the Muslim establishment of his time for dangerously violent and intolerant views. My high school teacher was appalled. He was upset that a Muslim was criticizing other Muslims. He didn't get it. 

Many Sunni Muslims do get it, and they need a voice. Dr. Zuhdi Jasser and the [Muslim Reform Movement](http://muslimreformmovement.org/) are such voices that the mainstream Ummah needs to hear.

And I commend [Mirza Ghulam Ahmad](http://www.muslimsforpeace.org/hazrat-mirza-ghulam-ahmad/) for his brave calling a spade a spade.

Look at the fruits. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has a following of 10+ million around the world, none of whom have ever been responsible for a terrorist attack. Ahmadi Muslims categorically [denounce terrorism](https://www.alislam.org/terrorism.html). 

### To @LoveTruth79
If you care about your Ummah, then you must point out the honest, unfortunate truths. Admitting there is a problem is the first step in solving it.

You must rally people behind you, to consciously reject dangerous ideas that smear Islam and to create a culture that embraces pluralistic ideals. Principles that improve society.

When you reject any criticism of intolerant interpretations of the faith, you fall into the hands of the pro-ISIS wing of the Muslim world.

Your quoting of [Surah Al-Baqara'ah 2:11](http://quran.com/2/11), reveals how you unknowingly render a disservice to your fellow Muslims. You see, not all reform is bad. Don't you espouse reading the Qur'an with some context and nuance? Don't you believe that _takfir_ is a sin?

Reform that calls out injustice is not bad. If you think it so, then you are part of the problem that holds Muslims back.
