In the following tweet of mine, I conjectured that even the commentary of an Ahmadi Muslim published Qur'an left the door open for an ex nihilo creation position:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ahmadi Muslims profess a position of guided evolution. However, their Qur&#39;anic commentaries DO allow for Creationism <a href="https://t.co/Pzevz87TzS">pic.twitter.com/Pzevz87TzS</a></p>&mdash; Reason on Faith (@ReasonOnFaith) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReasonOnFaith/status/741362911902371840">June 10, 2016</a></blockquote>

A better explanation of this verse put for by Ahmadi Muslims is that God is simply making an argument against Christian claims of a divine Jesus, by saying that if Christian think Jesus is divine because he had no human father, than what of the Adam of the Bible who had no human mother _nor_ a human father? 

The Ahmadi Muslim TV program, _Faith Matters_ explores this in [Program 77](https://youtu.be/B825iH4kqSU?t=4m40s).

The linked video to this tweet at time index 4:40 for about a minute, covers this explanation. It’s a good explanation except that the verse in the Qur’an does not itself present this qualifier attributed to it by the Ahmadi speaker, that the Christian concept of Adam is being referred to only.

Verse 3:60 of the Qur’an (or 3:59 if you use mainstream Islamic numbering systems) is making a confident statement of fact with no capitulation present that this view of Adam is exclusive to Christians.

> Surely, the case of Jesus with Allah is like the case of Adam. He created him out of dust, then said to him, 'Be,' and he was.

This is why it is more plausible that the Qur’an supports a literal creationist view of life, as espoused by early Muslims and even many mainstream Muslims in the present day.

The only room to maneuver for Ahmadis is to say that this isn’t God’s statement of fact of Islam’s position, but just rhetoric against the Christian understanding of an _ex nihilo_ creation of Adam.

The rejection of a straightforward reading of a particular verse may be defensible from time to time. But in order to sustain the theology and progress beyond mainstream Islam, I consistently have seen Ahmadiyyat making interpretations that are simply not borne out by the text of the verses themselves.

When you encounter such gymnastics over and over again, you have to ask yourself: 

1. What's most likely going on here?
2. Why does the God of the Qur'an seem to consistently speak plainly to a 7th century understanding?
3. What evidence from the earliest tafsirs of the Qur'an in Islamic history do Ahmadis cite for the vast majority of such acrobatics?
